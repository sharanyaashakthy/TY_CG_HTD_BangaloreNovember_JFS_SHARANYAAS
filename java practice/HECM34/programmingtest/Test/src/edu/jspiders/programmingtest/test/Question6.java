 * Write the logic for the program which returns the biggest peek element in the array.
 * 
 * peek element--> its an element which is greater than its neighbours.
 * 
 * i/p --> 5 6 4 3 2 8 4
 * 
 * in the above example we have 6 which is greater than 5 and 4 so its a peek element.
 * 
 * in the about input we have 6, 3 and 8 as peek element but the biggest is 8
 * 
 * 
 * marks --> 5
